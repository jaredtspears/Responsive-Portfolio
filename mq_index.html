                The programming adventure iniciated in the oddest of places, middle school.
                Albeit not when I was in middle school, but rather teaching middle school technology! 
                Suprise, my students kept me on my toes with their tech saviness, and so was born a
                passion to explore digital media to educate the youth of NC by way of programing Arduino's 
                and learning basic CAD programs.Interestingly enough this was only the first step to my programing initiation
                I created my first basic webpage for my students ClassRoom Website.
                I edited video, linked useful sites and compiled teh class around adventureous yet
                controlled learning. In the end, it quite fun to build this Google site, but it was...
                limiting. I was proud of my work but it was elementary as far as web design goes in
                today's world. I wanted more - so I did the unthinkable in my wheelhouse - 
                I signed up for a Coding BootCamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.

                Currently, I am developing a working knowledge of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 
                I plan is to maintain the goal ov becominga full stack developer with a focus on 
                UI. I am implementing these skills in my current career in education but hope to 
                have a new programming career in web development before the end of 2018.

                I am taking on clients for web development contract work. Additionally, Startups are 
                of great interest to me. I look forward to being on the ground floor of a new company big or small
                and talor my skills to meet the needs of a new vision.
